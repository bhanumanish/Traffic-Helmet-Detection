# Traffic-Helmet-Detection
Model for Tracking Two wheeler riders without helmet in traffic signal.
The main theme of the project is to bring empowerment in the public to use traffic 
safety gear especially Helmet by two wheeler riders to maximize their safety. The model's
capability is not only restricted to be used in the scenario of traffic safety but the 
application of it wide from construction sites to Proximity Emergency Braking System (PEBS)
a system made to apply strong breaks in heavy vehicles when a person is spotted near the
tyres at a distance to avoide running over the ryder.I suggest viewers to look at the text 
document attached to the following for applying it over in viewers system. I haven't
provided dataset used in the document. I suggest viewers to experiment different datasets and 
follow the instructions shown in the attached notebook.
